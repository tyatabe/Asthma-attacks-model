# Data_incub_challenge
Here I will publish my data, plots, and code
This is the place to find out all about this data incub project. Briefly, this project models asthma attack rates at the zip code level, using air quality data from monitoring stations in the US, which were interpolated for the whole country using environmental  predictors, specifically temperature, elevation, and wind speeds.
There are 2 main outcomes: 1) Predicted asthma rates per zip code, and 2) estimates of air quality at the country level. The predicted rates of asthma could be used by private and public health services for planning and resource allocation, by insurance companies, to estimate premiums, and for the public in general, by providing to them indicators of environmental justice in the country.
